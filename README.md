# Homework-4 - Web API - Timed Quiz App
Description:

Built a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. 
It will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.
By clicking on the "Start Quiz" button, the timer starts and the questions will be presented. For each wrong answer, 5 seconds will be subtracted from the timer. When all the questions are answered or the timer reached 0, the page with the user's final score and an input box for the initials are presented. On the last page, user can save their initials and scores in a list format.
